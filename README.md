# nuxt-bridge-test
## Overall idea

This is PoC of nuxt bridge and nuxt3 with Storyblok as headless CMS.
For now tailwind doesn't work properly so it is connected by CDN.
Everything else should work. To make it work basic Storyblok configuration (with initial template) is needed
## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ yarn dev

# build for production and launch server
$ yarn build
$ yarn start

# generate static project
$ yarn generate
```
